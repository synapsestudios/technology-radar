Specification by Example is a method for coming to a shared understanding of what software to build that replaces the need for traditional requirements documents. Teams that work in an agile way admit that they can't know enough up front to document all of the requirements of a system, but they can use Specification by Example in order to create just in time specifications, tests and shared understanding.

The heart of Specification by Example is to replace descriptions of functionality with examples. The examples are specific and concrete. They reduce or eliminate miscommunications, and they can be automated.

BDD is a framework for doing specification by example that Synapse has adopted. Acceptance test driven development is another common name for these techniques.
