The [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) family consists of a set of libraries designed to make testing user interfaces, especially in web applications, more effective and user-centric. The philosophy behind Testing Library is to prioritize testing from the user's perspective, focusing on the actual behavior and rendering output rather than internal implementation details. [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) is one of the members of this family and is specifically built for testing React components.

Synapse is adopting React Testing Library to elevate our testing approach. By prioritizing user-centric testing, we'll ensure our components behave as intended from the user's perspective, leading to more reliable and maintainable tests. This shift will enhance collaboration, reduce regression issues, and align our testing practices with modern best practices in the React community.
