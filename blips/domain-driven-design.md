[Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) is a philosophy that was popularized by Eric Evans that asserts that the best software designs are produced when the developers learn about the business domain and construct a model that is informed by that understanding and then implement that model as literally as possible in their code. Domain Driven Design requires systems to be able to isolate domain code, or business logic, from other concerns like network requests or database queries.

Systems built using Domain Driven Design will be easier to maintain, be less buggy, and be easier to modify with new capabilities. To learn more check out the [Domain Modeling Workshop](https://github.com/synapsestudios/coding-workshop) repo where you'll find some pattern documentation and modeling exercises.
