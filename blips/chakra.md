[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is a React component library which emphasizes accessibility, customization through theming, and simple component APIs. It gives a lot of nice features out of the box which can save a lot of development time, such as aria attributes, built-in focus management, a dark mode theme, and a responsive layout system. It also has excellent support for TypeScript, and has a very good [documentation site](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) with lots of examples. 

Synapse has used Chakra UI for a few years now, and we have found it to be a very good fit for our needs.
