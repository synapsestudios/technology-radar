[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) is a React component library which emphasizes accessibility, customization through theming, and simple component APIs. It gives a lot of nice features out of the box which can save a lot of development time, such as aria attributes, built-in focus management, a dark mode theme, and a responsive layout system. It also has excellent support for TypeScript. 

When getting started adding Chakra UI to an app, you should expect to spend a bit of time up-front configuring your app's theme, but once that's set up, you can use the components in your app with very little additional styling. We've found this to be a big win for productivity, in many cases eliminating the need for an extra design pass. It also makes it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel across the app.
