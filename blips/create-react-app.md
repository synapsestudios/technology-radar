Create React App is a command line tool that will create a react project for you that will include testing, a local dev server, and build scripts. It is fairly opinionated, but that's what it's for.

CRA has fallen out of regular use with the broader community and is no longer recommened on the [react website](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project). For that reason Synapse will no longer be bootstrapping applications with CRA.
