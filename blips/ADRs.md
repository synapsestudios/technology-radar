Significant architectural decisions can be captured with an Architecture Decision Record (ADR). Documenting the decisions that teams make about the high level design strategies and techniques makes it easier for new members to join the team, and provides a useful shared reference for agreed upon standards.

Synapse recommends installing [https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to help manage ADRs as markdown files in your repositories. More references can be found describing how to use ADRs [here](https://adr.github.io/) and [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record)
